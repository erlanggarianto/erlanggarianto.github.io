Place your assets in this folder:

- resume.pdf — exported resume to be linked from the homepage CTA
- profile.jpg — optional portrait image for the hero section (recommended ~1200x900)
- project images — optional visuals for projects (optimize for web, < 300 KB each)

Notes:
- If you add images, reference them from /assets in your HTML.
- Keep filenames lowercase and hyphenated.
- Consider running images through an optimizer (e.g., Squoosh) before committing.
